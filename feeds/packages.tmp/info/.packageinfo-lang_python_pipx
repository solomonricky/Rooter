Description: pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written
in Python. It's roughly similar to macOS's brew, JavaScript's npx, and
Linux's apt.

It's closely related to pip. In fact, it uses pip, but is focused on
installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command
line directly as applications.
