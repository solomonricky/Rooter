Title: Thermal monitoring and testing tool

Type: ipkg
Description:   As hardware vendors cope with the thermal constraints on their products,
  more and more sensors are added, new cooling capabilities are introduced.
  To expose such relationship to the userspace, Linux generic thermal layer
  introduced sysfs entry at /sys/class/thermal with a matrix of symbolic
  links, trip point bindings, and device instances. To traverse such
  matrix by hand is not a trivial task.
  'TMON' is conceived as a tool to help visualize, tune, and test the
  complex thermal subsystem.
